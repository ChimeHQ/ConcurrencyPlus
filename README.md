# ConcurrencyPlus
Utilities for working with Swift Concurrency

This is a really small library with some type and extensions that may be useful when working with Swift's concurrency system.

- A `TaskQueue` for queuing tasks in FIFO ordering
- `CheckedContinuation` extensions for improved ergnomics
- `Task` extensions for improved ergnomics when used to bridge to non-async code
- `NSXPCConnection` extensions for safe async integration
- `MainActor.runUnsafely` to help work around incorrectly- or insufficently-annotated code not under your control

📖 [Documentation][documentation] is available in DocC format.
